# Manual Code Testing README

In this folder, we have all of the code that goes into manually testing the targets included in the pipeline. All files with `EA_` prefix are files that Emma Atkinson used to compile river-level data from CU-level data provided by PSF. These files and the processes therein are **not** incorporated to the targets pipeline. 

All files with **no** `EA_` prefix are written by Cole and are incorporated into the targets pipeline.
