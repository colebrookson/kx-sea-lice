Three pieces of data: 

1. Wild lice on wild fish data - this comes from KXX
2. Lice on farmed fish data - from Sean (2 files, 1 up to 2019, and one updated to present)
3. Spawner-recruit data
4. Monthly stock data from farms

Problem for the current dataset will be that there are very ew years

Also the inventory data is much more shit (only goes back to 2005) 

Two versions of the inventory datafile (I now have the convo) 

With the location data - make sure all the locations that sean sent me are in the image that he sent as well 

Notes for me: 

* Sea lice trends are much different in this region
* might actually be no effect at all 
* The reason there's maybe no effect is there's few farms, and they're further away from the rivers 
* Peter didn't do anything for the central coast ---- could try to do this????? 
* One analytical problem is that the fish don't migrate one direction through a fjord, there's some options for them in terms of where they go -- in the methods doc there's a first pass at this, and they classify fish as exposed, non-expsosed, and ones that were within 30km as partially exposed 

First steps:

* Cole would like to do power analysis first 

3-5 pages (2 pages of writing) 

* include timeline with just ktc, the mortality figure, map, and the log-log regression ----- the rest goes in SI
