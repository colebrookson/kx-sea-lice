# Meeting Notes

# Cole's List of Running Questions

1. Where the heck are areas 02E and 02W?
2. Cougar Bay, Oscar, and Arthur don't appear in the metadata of the farms - do they have another name??
3. In the BATI report we constrained to March April --- is there a month-based constraint we should do here? right now I'm not using any 
4. Here, we have area 7 as our area "with" farms, but in the BATI report we use it as a control??? confusion as to why we can do that for BATI
5. Also, Alexander Bay is in area 6?
6. For the BATI analysis, we treated lice data from like 91-00 as NA's since it's possible the effect started already - should we be doing that here too? For what years if so? 

### Meeting With Sean 2023 - 

1. Looking for location data for Cougar Bay fish farm - found it: 52.743511, -128.587263
2. Wild salmon monitoring sites questions - do we include all of them? Sean's suggestion: exclude the top most green point (green control one), try excluding the green one nearest to that point as well, the green one inside the little red octagon thing 
3. Use only March and April
4. Redo the regression of wild and farmed with all lice not just the motiles
5. get the map ready for meeting -- determine which pop'ns are exposed/unexposed
6. question for christina is about the lice being inputed as NA's ----- some populations will be exposed in some years but not exposed in others 
7. Also for the meeting, have a map for every year of farms taht were active in every year, with the salmon populations that are close to coming into contact with those farms - that we have a stock recruit pairs for --- 3 pairs each 
8.
