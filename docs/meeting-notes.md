# Cole's List of Running Questions

1. Where the heck are areas 02E and 02W?
2. Cougar Bay, Oscar, and Arthur don't appear in the metadata of the farms - do they have another name??
3. In the BATI report we constrained to March April --- is there a month-based constraint we should do here? right now I'm not using any
