# Cole's List of Running Questions

1. Where the heck are areas 02E and 02W?
2. Cougar Bay, Oscar, and Arthur don't appear in the metadata of the farms - do they have another name??
3. In the BATI report we constrained to March April --- is there a month-based constraint we should do here? right now I'm not using any 
4. Here, we have area 7 as our area "with" farms, but in the BATI report we use it as a control??? confusion as to why we can do that for BATI
5. Also, Alexander Bay is in area 6?
6. For the BATI analysis, we treated lice data from like 91-00 as NA's since it's possible the effect started already - should we be doing that here too? For what years if so?
