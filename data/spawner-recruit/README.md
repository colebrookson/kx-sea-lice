# Spawner-Recruit (SR) Data README

A first pass analysis of these data used a slightly outdated version of data, which limited the years of spawner-recruit data that could be compiled. 

We updated these data in April 2023 through a sub-contract to Emma Atkinson, and she performed a river-level roll-down of CU-level data to rivers across the study region. We then used those data for the subsequent analyses. 

The "cleaned" data at the end of E. Atkinson's contract is the data file `./raw/river-level-sr/NCC_streams_river-level_SR_data_2023-04-19.csv`, even though it's been genuinely cleaned, it's placed in the raw folder to make it clear where it falls in the analysis pipeline. That is, it's the file that gets used in the subequent cleaning that C. Brookson does.
